# Containers for test usage

## NetworkManager

### NetworkManager on CentOS Stream 10

```bash
sudo ./run.sh nm c10s
```

### NetworkManager on CentOS Stream 9

```bash
sudo ./run.sh nm c9s
```

## IPSec

By default, this script will create both server and client containers.

Passing `--server-only` will only create server container and load IPSec
keys to local ipsec database.

### IPSec using PSK authentication

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec psk
```

### IPSec using RSA authentication

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec rsa
```

### IPSec using PKI authentication

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec cert
```

### IPSec P2P connection

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec p2p
```

### IPSec Site-to-Site connection

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec site2site
```

### IPSec Transport connection (p2p only)

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec transport
```

### IPSec Host-to-Site connection

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec host2site
```

### IPSec IPv4 in IPv6 and IPv6 in IPv4 connection

```bash
sudo ./run.sh ipsec mix46
```
